    <p>
      Please ensure that your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a
        duplicate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure your contribution is useful and relevant before submitting.
        That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct
        description.
      </li>
      <li>Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.</li>
      <li>
        Use the following format:
        <code
          >- [Repository Name](link-to-repository-label) _(label:
          beginner-friendly-label-in-the-repository)_ &lt;br&gt;
          Description</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Example link formatting:
        <code
          >-
          [awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners/labels/good-first-contribution)
          _(label: good-first-contribution)_ &lt;br&gt; A list of awesome
          beginners-friendly projects.</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
      </li>
      <li>
        New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are
        welcome.
      </li>
      <li>Check your spelling and grammar.</li>
      <li>Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.</li>
      <li>The pull request and commit should be given a meaningful title.</li>
      <li>Ensure that you describe your pull request.</li>
      <li>
        If the label does not clearly state it&#39;s &quot;beginner
        friendly&quot; purpose, please make sure to confirm with the maintainer
        that it is used for such issues. Please include the link to where the
        maintainer approves it in the PR. See examples below:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Repository called &quot;HornsAndHoovesJs&quot; has label
            <code>good-first-contribution</code>. This PR does not need to be
            confirmed with the maintainer and can be merged straight away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repository called &quot;bicycle-wheels-php&quot; has label
            <code>easy</code>. This PR must be confirmed with the maintainer of
            &quot;bicycle-wheels-php&quot;. The issue link where the maintainer
            confirms that label <code>easy</code> is used in the repository for
            beginner-friendly tasks has to be provided in the PR description.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintainer confirmation is also required in case repository has more
        than one beginner-friendly-like label (e.g.
        <code>low-hanging-fruit</code> and <code>up-for-grabs</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The contributed repository must be maintained, have an active community
        to be able to help newcomers and have issues with an appropriate label.
      </li>
      <li>
        Links must be pointing directly to the repository, no tracking links
        allowed. This list is not for advertising purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you for your suggestions!</p>
